Description: Estimate prior variable weights for Bayesian Additive Regression
    Trees (BART). These weights correspond to the probabilities of the variables
    being selected in the splitting rules of the sum-of-trees.
    Weights are estimated using empirical Bayes and external information on 
    the explanatory variables (co-data).
    BART models are fitted using the 'dbarts' 'R' package.
