Description: Estimate prior variable weights for 
    Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. These weights correspond to the probabilities of the variables
    being selected in the splitting rules of the sum-of-trees.
    The weights are estimated using empirical Bayes 
    and external information on the explanatory variables (co-data).
